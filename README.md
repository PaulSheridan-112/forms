**HTML & CSS Forms**

My goal in this exercise was to replicate Mint.com's signup page.

The aim of the exercise was to make it look like the signup page but
without the need to actually collect the data entered on the form.


I found this exercise quite simple and completed it within a short space of
time.

The exercise was part of the Odin Project's curriculum.
